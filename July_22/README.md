**Wave light using Analog and Digital Sensors** 

For my project, I lined up 3 LED lights to create a mini light wave. A switch (digital sensor) was used to start the wave by lighting the first LED light. A photoresister (analog sensor) was placed next to the first LED light to detect whether it was on or not. If it was on, it would tell the next two LED lights to tun on.
