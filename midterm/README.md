**Midterm Project: Ocil8** 

![](oscil8.png)


***Inspiration***
My game was inspired by the singer, Bruno Major's, single album cover for his song ["Nothing"](https://i2.wp.com/coolhunting.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bruno-major-nothing.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1).
The album cover is very clean as it played with moving circles and lines that I found to be very visually appealing and calming. I wanted to turn the circles and lines (similar to the form of mallets) in my game with the addition of interactive rain and audio visualizers. 

Describe the rules you used to create this artwork and briefly how you programmed this to happen.

Three main rules I used to create the program were functions, conditionals, and for loops. 


Describe any difficulties you had and how you overcame them
***Interesting Finds***
bufferSize 
calculating distance for circles is a lot easier than rectangular shapes compared to last game
