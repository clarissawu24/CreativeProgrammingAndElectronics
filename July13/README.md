I was inspired by the "Loop Mouse" example by Daniel Shiffman in *Learning Processing* http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp06/example-06-09-loop-mouse
I really liked the concept of having a trail of bars following the mouse as it hovered over the canvas, so I tried to play around to see what I could do to incorporate more color to the process.
