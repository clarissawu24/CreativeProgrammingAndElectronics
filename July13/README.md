I was inspired by the "Loop Mouse" example by Daniel Shiffman in [*Learning Processing*] (http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp06/example-06-09-loop-mouse)
I really liked the concept of having a trail of bars following the mouse as it hovered over the canvas, so I tried to play around to see what I could do to incorporate more color to the process. 
I wanted to recreate the moving bars to also include a wavy effect so in order to this I used the rect() function to reference the mouseY position to be the maximum height from the bottom of the canvas.
