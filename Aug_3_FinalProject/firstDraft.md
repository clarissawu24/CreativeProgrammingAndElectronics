**Final Project Proposal: Interactive Wave** 

I was really inspired by Reuben Margolin's works as he used the logic of math and nature in his pieces. My favorite ones are his wave projects. They're so mezmerizing and surprisingly require precise equations to recreate. 
Since his pieces require the use of exactly measured and cut wood, I'm not sure if I'll have access to those so I'm hoping I may be able to create an interactive wave with the following materials. 

***Material***
- Wooden dowels: to hold the wave
- Mesh cloth: to be the wave
- LED lights: to add color to the wave
- Arduino proximity detecter: for the element of iteraction where your distance will effect the amplitude of the wave
- Motors: to move the dowels to create the waves 
- Strings: for positioning and holding things together 
- Hot glue gun/tape: to secure elements in place
